Solution of the above problem:-
class Solution {
public:
  int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
 int x=0;
        int n=operations.size();
        while(n--)
        {
            if(operations[n]=="--X") --x;
            else if(operations[n]=="X--")x--;
            else if(operations[n]=="X++")x++;
            else if(operations[n]=="++X")++x;
        }
        return x;
    }
Explanation of the above code:-
Initialization:

int x = 0;: Initialize a variable x to 0. This variable will be updated based on the operations.
Processing Operations:

int n = operations.size();: Get the size of the operations vector.
while (n--) { ... }: Loop through each operation in reverse order.
Operation Handling:

Check the type of each operation and update the value of x accordingly.
If the operation is "--X", decrement x by 1.
If the operation is "X--", decrement x by 1.
If the operation is "X++", increment x by 1.
If the operation is "++X", increment x by 1.
Return Final Value:

return x;: Return the final value of x after all operations have been processed.
