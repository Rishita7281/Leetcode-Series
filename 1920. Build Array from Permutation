Solution of 1920:-Build Array from Permutation 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Declare a vector to store the result
        vector<int> res;

        // Iterate through each element in the nums array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Add the element at the index specified by the current element in nums
            res.push_back(nums[nums[i]]);
        }

        // Return the resulting array
        return res;
    }
};

Explanation of the above code:-

1.Class Declaration:
The code defines a class named Solution.

2.Public Method:
The class has a public method buildArray that takes a vector of integers (nums).

3.Result Vector:
Inside the method, a vector res is declared. This vector will be used to store the elements of the resulting array.

4.Iteration through nums:
The code uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the nums array.

5.Building the Resulting Array (res):
For each element in nums, the code does the following:
nums[i]: Retrieves the value at the current index i in the original array nums.
res.push_back(nums[nums[i]]): Adds the value at the index specified by the current element in nums to the res vector.

6.Return Statement:
Finally, the method returns the resulting vector res.
